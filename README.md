**Reisen X Image Viewer**

The sole purpose of rxiv is because sxiv won't add many sensible features and it seems abandoned by the author.

Reisen X Image Viewer is named after Reisen Udongein Inaba from Touhou.

Features
--------

* Basic image operations, e.g. zooming, panning, rotating
* Customizable key and mouse button mappings (in *config.h*)
* Thumbnail mode: grid of selectable previews of all images
* Ability to cache thumbnails for fast re-loading
* Basic support for multi-frame images
* Load all frames from GIF files and play GIF animations
* Full webp support
* View images from URL (through included wrapper `rxiv-url` for now)
* Start from file (through included wrapper `rxiv-browser` for now)
* Partial svg support (only on image mode for now)
* Display image information in status bar
* Configurable title
* Configurable bar colors

Dependencies
------------

sxiv requires the following software to be installed:

  * Imlib2
  * X11
  * Xft
  * freetype2
  * fontconfig
  * librsvg2
  * giflib (optional, disabled with `HAVE_GIFLIB=0`)
  * libexif (optional, disabled with `HAVE_LIBEXIF=0`)
  * libgen

Please make sure to install the corresponding development packages in case that
you want to build rxiv on a distribution with separate runtime and development
packages (e.g. *-dev on Debian).


Building
--------

rxiv is built using the commands:

    $ make
    # make install

Please note, that the latter one requires root privileges.
By default, rxiv is installed using the prefix "/usr/local", so the full path
of the executable will be "/usr/local/bin/rxiv".

You can install rxiv into a directory of your choice by changing the second
command to:

    # make PREFIX="/your/dir" install

The build-time specific settings of rxiv can be found in the file *config.h*.
Please check and change them, so that they fit your needs.
If the file *config.h* does not already exist, then you have to create it with
the following command:

    $ make config.h


Usage
-----

Please see the [man page](https://eylles.github.io/rxiv/rxiv.1.html) for
information on how to use sxiv.
